    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="text">
            <p>I was born in Cambridge, MA. I am 16 years old.
            My favorite subjects in school are languages and STEM.
            I am studying abroad in Spain in 2 days, at a private
            school called Colegio Aljarafe.</p>
            
            <p> Last year I took AP Spanish Language. I scored a 5
            on the exam last year, so I'm considered bilingual by
            the state of MA. I'm excited to improve my Spanish
            and have a chance to live in another country.</p>
            <h3>Career Aspirations</h3>

            <p>I would like to go to a good university to study computer
            science, or engineering. If I study computer science, I want
            to study and work on AI. If I study engineering, I
            want to go into aerospace. I want to learn German and work
            in Germany, and maybe go to university there too. Once I've
            had a career in CS/engineering, I want to become a professor.</p>
